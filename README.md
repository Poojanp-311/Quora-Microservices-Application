# Building Quora with Microservices in Java Spring Boot


Micro-services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This can improve the performance, reliability, and maintainability of the application

For example, a Q&A platform like Quora can have services like User Service, Answer Service, Question Service, Search Service, and Recommendation Service, each service has a specific function and communicates with other services through well-defined interfaces making them independent of each other.
